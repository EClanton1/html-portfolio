<h1>The Best Movies According To Erik</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies Of All Time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Fast and Furious Series</h3>
<p>I know it's not a single movie but the entire <br/>
series is action packed and suspensefull all throughout</p>

<h3>The Avengers: End Game</h3>
<p>Very deep spiritual undertones and challenges <br/>
your paradigm of thinking of a simple, complete world</p>

<h3>Creed II</h3>
<p>Gritty, Grungy and suspenseful. I'm a former athlete, <br/>
so I love movies with this type of plot and theme</p>
