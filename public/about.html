<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello. My name is Erik Clanton and I'm here to tell you a little about me. All my life I've been told that I have 
  a very technical mind and the way I look at things was always different than most kids and people my age. I would
  take apart things that seemed to be too complex for some and end up putting it back together without instruction, 
  the same exact way.
</p>

<p>I struggled at first to fit in with the kids so I began to get active and play sports for a significant portion of 
  my life, which I enjoyed very much. However, after getting into law enforcement for almost ten years, the climate of
  society began to change and so have I. I began to rekindle the extinguished fire of the technicality of solving 
  problems.
</p>

<p>I want to solve the problems that society faces by creating, building, improving and deploying secure and scalable
  web applications. I AM A PROBLEM SOLVER. I AM CREATIVE. I AM A WEB DEVELOPER.</p>
